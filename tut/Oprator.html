		<strong><h3>Operators</h3></strong>
	</div>
		<div>
			<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Airthmetic Operators</li>
				<li>Relational Operators</li>
				<li>Logical Operators</li>
				<li>Bitwise Operators</li>
				<li>Assignment Operators</li>
				<li>Misc Operators</li>
			</ul>
				<h4>Arithmetic Operators</h4>
				<p>Following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then:</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Operator</th>
						<th>Description</th>
						<th>Example</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>+</td>
						<td>Adds two operands</td>
						<td>A + B will give 30</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>-</td>
						<td>Subtracts second operand from the first</td>
						<td>A - B will give -10</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>*</td>
						<td>Multiplies both operands</td>
						<td>A * B will give 200</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>/</td>
						<td>Divides numerator by de-numerator</td>
						<td>B / A will give 2</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>%</td>
						<td>Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division</td>
						<td>B % A will give 0</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>++</td>
						<td>Increments operator increases integer value by one</td>
						<td>A++ will give 11</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>--</td>
						<td>Decrements operator decreases integer value by one</td>
						<td>A-- will give 9</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<code>Try the following example to understand all the arithmetic operators available in C programming language:</code>
				<div class="case">
				<pre class="brush: cpp">
						include &ltstdio.h&gt
						main()
						{
						int a = 21
						int b = 10
						int c 
						c = a + b;
						printf("Line 1 - Value of c is %d\n", c )
						c = a - b
						printf("Line 2 - Value of c is %d\n", c )
						c = a * b;
						printf("Line 3 - Value of c is %d\n", c )
						c = a / b
						printf("Line 4 - Value of c is %d\n", c )
						c = a % b
						printf("Line 5 - Value of c is %d\n", c )
						c = a++
						printf("Line 6 - Value of c is %d\n", c )
						c = a--
						printf("Line7 - Value of c is %d\n", c )
						}
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result:</p>
					<div class="case">
						<code>
							Line 1 - Value of c is 31<br>
							Line 2 - Value of c is 11<br>
							Line 3 - Value of c is 210<br>
							Line 4 - Value of c is 2<br>
							Line 5 - Value of c is 1<br>
							Line 6 - Value of c is 21<br>
							Line 7 - Value of c is 22<br>
						</code>
					</div>
				<h4>Relational Operators</h4>
				<p>Following table shows all the relational operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then:</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Operator</th>
						<th>Description</th>
						<th>Example</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>==</td>
						<td>Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not,if yes then condition becomes true.</td>
						<td>(A == B) is not true.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>!=</td>
						<td>Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.</td>
						<td>(A != B) is true.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> &gt</td>
						<td>Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td>
						<td>(A > B) is not true.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>&lt </td>
						<td>Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true</td>
						<td>(A < B) is true.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> &gt=</td>
						<td>Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td>
						<td>(A >= B) is not true.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>&lt=</td>
						<td>Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td>
						<td>(A <= B) is true.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<h4>Logical Operators</h4>	
				<p>Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then:</p>		
					<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Operator</th>
						<th>Description</th>
						<th>Example</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>&&</td>
						<td>Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then condition becomes true.</td>
						<td>(A && B) is false..</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>||</td>
						<td>Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then condition becomes true.</td>
						<td>(A || B) is true.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> !</td>
						<td>Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make false.</td>
						<td>!(A && B) is true.</td>
					</tr>
					</table>
					<h4>Misc Operator </h4>	
					<p>There are few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by C Language.</p>	
					<table>
						<tr>
							<th>Operator</th>
							<th>Description</th>
							<th>Example</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>sizeof()</td>
							<td>Returns the size of an variable.</td>
							<td>sizeof(a), where a is integer, will return 4.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>&</td>
							<td>Returns the address of an variable.</td>
							<td> &a; will give actual address of the variable.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td> *</td>
							<td>Pointer to a variable.</td>
							<td>*a; will pointer to a variable.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td> ?:</td>
							<td>Conditional Expression</td>
							<td>If Condition is true ? Then value X : Otherwise value Y</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<h4>Operators Precedence in C</h4>	
						<p>
						Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression. This affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator.<br>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.<br>
						Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.
