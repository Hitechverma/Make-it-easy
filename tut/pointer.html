				<h4>What Are Pointers?</h4>
				<p>A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before you can use it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is:</p>
				<p class="case">
					type *var-name;
				</p>
				<p>Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * you used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk that you use for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Following are the valid pointer declaration:</p>
				<pre class="brush: cpp">
					int *ip;
					double *dp;
					float *fp;
					char *ch;
				</pre>
				<p>The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.</p>
				<h4>How to use Pointers?</h4>
				<p>There are few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) we define a pointer variable (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. Following example makes use of these operations:</p> 		
				<pre class="brush: cpp">
					#include &ltstdio.h&gt
					int main ()
					{
					int var = 20;  /* actual variable declaration */
					int *ip;		/* pointer variable declaration */
					ip = &var;		/* store address of var in pointer variable*/
					printf("Address of var variable: %x\n", &var);
					/* address stored in pointer variable */
					printf("Address stored in ip variable: %x\n", ip );
					/* access the value using the pointer */
					printf("Value of *ip variable: %d\n", *ip );
					return 0;
					}
				</pre>
				<p>OutPut:</p>
				<div class="case">
					<code>
						Address of var variable: bffd8b3c
						<br>Address stored in ip variable: bffd8b3c
						<br>Value of *ip variable: 20
					</code>
				</div>

					<h4>NULL Pointers in C</h4>
					<p>It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.</p>
					<p>The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program:</p>
					<pre class="brush: cpp">
						#include &ltstdio.h&gt
						int main ()
						{
						int *ptr = NULL;
						printf("The value of ptr is : %x\n", &ptr);
						return 0;
						}
						</pre>
						<h5>Pointer arithmetic</h5>
						<p>As explained in main chapter, C pointer is an address, which is a numeric value. Therefore, you can perform arithmetic operations on a pointer just as you can a numeric value. There are four arithmetic operators that can be used on pointers: ++, --, +, and -</p>

					<h4>Array of pointers</h4>
					<p>Before we understand the concept of arrays of pointers, let us consider the following example, which makes use of an array of 3 integers:</p>
					<pre class="brush: cpp">
						#include &ltstdio.h&gt
						const int MAX = 3;
						int main ()
						{
						int var[] = {10, 100, 200};
						int i;
						for (i = 0; i &lt MAX; i++)
						{
						printf("Value of var[%d] = %d\n", i, var[i] );
						}
						return 0;
						}
					</pre>
					<div class="case">
						<code>
							Value of var[0] = 10
							<br>Value of var[1] = 100
							<br>Value of var[2] = 200
						</code>
					</div>
			</section>

					<h4>Pointer to Pointer</h4>
					<p>A pointer to a pointer is a form of multiple indirection, or a chain of pointers. Normally, a pointer contains the address of a variable. When we define a pointer to a pointer, the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer, which points to the location that contains the actual value as shown below.</p>
					<img src="../imgs/pointer.jpg" width="100%">
					<p>When a target value is indirectly pointed to by a pointer to a pointer, accessing that value requires that the asterisk operator be applied twice, as is shown below in the example:</p>
					<pre class="brush: cpp">
						#include &ltstdio.h&gt
						int main ()
						{
						int var;
						int *ptr;
						int **pptr;
						var = 3000;
						/* take the address of var */
						ptr = &var;
						/* take the address of ptr using address of operator & */
						pptr = &ptr;
						/* take the value using pptr */
						printf("Value of var = %d\n", var );
						printf("Value available at *ptr = %d\n", *ptr );
						printf("Value available at **pptr = %d\n", **pptr);
						return 0;
						}
					</pre>
					<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>
					<div class="case">
						<code>
							Value of var = 3000
							<br>Value available at *ptr = 3000
							<br>Value available at **pptr = 300
							<br>
						</code>
					</div>

					<h4>Passing pointers to functions</h4>
					<p>C programming language allows you to pass a pointer to a function. To do so, simply declare the function parameter as a pointer type.</p>
					<pre class="brush: cpp">
						void getSeconds(unsigned long *par);	/*Delclaration*/
						getSeconds( &sec );		/*Calling*/	
						void getSeconds(unsigned long *par)
						{
						/* get the current number of seconds */
						*par = time( NULL );
						return;
						}
						</pre>
						<p>As we have seen in last chapter how C programming language allows to return an array from a function, similar way C allows you to return a pointer from a function.</p>
